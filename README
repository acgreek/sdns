sdns - Secure DNS.  

Put the sdns files in /sdns - typically, like this:

	cd /;tar -xvpf sdns.tar

If you wish to use the dsitributed setup (you almost certainly do not) as root type:
	'sdns'

If you wish to customize sdns, read the rest of this document.

=========== Components:

README		This file

makefile	The makefile for this directory
		Type 'make' to update sdns to reflect changes

gogo		This is a short shell script that loops forever running sdns
		It is typically invoked from /etc/rc.d/rc.local

go		This kills the sdns process, allowing an update to be made.
		If gogo invoked sdns, killing sdns will cause a restart.

hosts		This is the hosts file used to create the lookup tables for sdns

defaults	This is the defaul domain file that specifies default answers for whole domains

convert.pl	This is a perl script that creates table.h from hosts and defaults

table.h		This is the part of the sdns program that specifies answers to specific
		inquiries on your system.  It is generated from 'defaults' and 'hosts'
		by convert.pl

sdns.c		This is the C source program for serving DNS inquiries

sdns		This is the executable program for serving DNS inquiries

=========== Operation:

sdns listens on port 53 for DNS requests and replies to them, logging results in
the 'logfile' file in the /sdns directory.

=========== Changes:

The easiest change to make is to copy a 'hosts' file (typically
/etc/hosts) into the /sdns directory:
	cp /etc/hosts /sdns

Then type make:
	mv sdns zz;make

Then, if you have used 'gogo' to get the sdns running, type:
	go

This will invoke the changes.

To change default domains, edit 'defauls' then use:
	mv sdns zz;make
	go
as above.



======================= This describes how to build dns packets with multiple resource records

DNS
16	id 		same as question id
1	qr		1 for response
4	opcode	0 for standard query
1	AA		1 for authoritative answer
1	TC		0 for no truncations
1	rd		same as question rd recursion desired
1	ra		0 for no recursion available.
3	z		0 for reserved for future use
4	rcode	0 for no error, 3 for nonexistent host/domain
16	qdc		same as question qdc (hopefully 1)
16	anc		N - number of answer resource records
16	nsc		0 for no ns RRs
16	arc		0 for no additional RRs

QUESTION
XX 	qname	same as question qname
16 	qtype	same as question qtype
16 	qclass	same as question qclass
ANSWER * N
XX	name	0xC00C - numchars chars format of name in compressed format
16	type	1 - host address (IP), 12 - domain name
16	class	1 for internet
32	ttl		0 for no caching, 3600 (0xE10) - 1 hour
16	rdlen   L - length of rdata field
XX	rdata	numchars chars format of answer
